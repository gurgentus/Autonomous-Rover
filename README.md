# Autonomous-Rover
Autonomous rover capable of navigating through an environment autonomously (ROS, computer vision, control, Kalman filtering; MATLAB, Python)

# TODO

- [X] Path planning: Dijkstra's algorithm with an known map
- [X] Localization: AprilTags, Estimation: Kalman Filter
- [X] Control: PID
- [X] Test on hardware
- [ ] Use machine learning for localization instead of AprilTags
- [ ] Add optimal control
- [ ] SLAM
